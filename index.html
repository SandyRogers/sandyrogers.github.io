                    I write code, mostly in Python and React.js.
                    Currently I work at <a href="#Saberr">Saberr</a>.
                    I‚Äôm most interested in the natural language processing part of my job.
                    Before that, my PhD was <a href="#Astronomy">astrophysics research.</a>

                    My email address looks like my name, in the same way that my URL <a href="http://sa.ndyroge.rs">sa.ndyroge.rs</a> does. Provided you think that an <span class="mono">@</span> looks like an <span class="mono">a</span> you can work it out :)

                        My PhD was at the <a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk">Royal Observatory</a>, <a href="https://ed.ac.uk">Edinburgh</a>. My project mostly used the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to look at very distance galaxies. They are far enough away that we look back into the early Universe when we see them (within the first billion years of its 13 billion year history).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We looked for the earliest, faintest galaxies we could find (a few hundred of them at redshift 5 to 9). By carefully measuring their colours and comparing them to computer models of stars and galaxies, we worked out the galaxies‚Äô stellar populations &mdash; the types of stars they contained. The tricky parts were working with very faint galaxies in very noisy image data, measuring colours without bias, and figuring out both the distance to the galaxies as well as their properties (they can have similar patterns).

                    <p>
                        I work at <a href="https://www.saberr.com">Saberr</a>, a tech startup focussed on teamwork development.
                        I do research and data analysis, as well as full-stack software development, to help make our apps (and various other things &mdash; we‚Äôre a small company).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our main product is CoachBot, an app that helps teams in some of the ways a coach would.
                        Since most collaborative work centres around meetings, it has lots of features that turn a calendar event into a a well structured workplace conversation.
                        I‚Äôm most interested in how to detect the signs that people need help with a partciular issue, and how to deliver automated guidance at just the right moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favourite feature to work on was <a href="https://medium.com/@sndyrgrs/highlighting-keywords-in-context-with-dependency-parsing-95c1e6a3f334">Smart Tips</a>: a natural language processing feature that annotates users‚Äô meeting agendas with relevant expert guides to help them.
                    It was interesting because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We didn‚Äôt have much training data, so had to do as much as possible using pre-trained language models and a small expert dataset.</li>
                        <li>We used dependency-parsing in a way that was shown to users to help them understand what CoachBot was trying to guide them on (and why).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I used <a href="https://spacy.io">SpaCy</a> to develop the NLP for that (and <a href="https://blog.saberr.com/7-experiments-in-natural-language-understanding-for-coachbot-308f79843795">several other prototypes</a> that haven‚Äôt yet been needed in production).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spend most of my time using <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org">React.js</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.

                    <h3>A training journal app for runners</h3>
                    <p>
                        My current side project is an app that encourages runners to keep a training journal.
                        It integrates with <a href="https://www.strava.com">Strava</a> and let‚Äôs athletes keep a private diary of their training.
                        The aim is to encourage more honest training notes, and to guide runners to periodise their training to avoid burnout or injury.
                        It‚Äôs built using <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org">React.js</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>An app for conference networking, with emojis</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="http://www.bbmscambridge.com">Building Bridges in Medical Science</a> conference tries to help their attendees make useful connections each year.
                        They have a history of trying out innovative networking tech to help.
                        For the 2017 and 2018 conferences, I made an emoji based meet-and-share-contacts app, called EmojiBadg.es.
                        The app starts with a list of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk">Eventbrite</a> attendees, and makes printable name badges for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each badge has an emoji code on it, like üê®Ô∏èüå≤Ô∏èüìéÔ∏èüçéÔ∏è.
                        People can share their own contact info, and get somebody else's, by keying an emoji code into the web app on their phone.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A bot to help with awkward conversations in Slack</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.slack.com">Slack</a> is a business chat app.
                        People use Slack for work, so are almost always not anonymous.
                        This is good &ndash; Slack encourage <a href="https://slack.com/customer-stories/ocado">transparent communication</a> &ndash; but means that people might not talk about controversial or awkward topics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a side-project at Saberr, we made a Slack bot called Elephant.chat to help teams talk about their "Elephants in the room".
                        Anybody could ask Elephant a question they wanted their team to talk about.
                        Elephant would then ask that question to the whole team, without the originator being named.
                        Everybody could tell Elephant their answers, which were turned into a wordcloud to aggregate and anonymise the answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea was that Elephant would help people with the tricky part of starting an awkward conversation.
